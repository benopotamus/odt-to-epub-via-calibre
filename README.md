# odt-to-epub-via-calibre
A command line script for converting LibreOffice ODT files to EPUBs using Calibre's command line tool. It is specific to my book but could be useful for you.

It does the following:
* Converts to EPUB
* Uses the ODT heading styles to create the table of contents
* Inserts a page break before each chapter
* Fixes a little quirk (using CSS) to do with list elements
